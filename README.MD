# Git Instructions

Basic instructions to install Git and getting started.

Before performing the following steps make sure git is installed on your local machines.

Step 1. Clone the repo.(Working - takes the file from the git repo and make a copy of it into your local machine)

```
git clone https://github.com/raghavgrover21/bvicam2021.git
```

Step 2. Once cloned you should see a folder with the repo name, now cd into the folder and run the following command to create your own branch so that you can get going.

```
 git checkout -b DataStructure_YourRollNo(DataStructure is a branch name and roll no to identify your work uniquely)
```

Step 3. You will find a folder by the name of repo bvicam2021, CD into it and start adding your code file to that folder, once that is done. Do the following

```
Follow the order.
1. git add *file_name* (keep it generic eg. Stack, Queue)
2. git commit -m "your message (in 1 line explain what your program does)"
3. git push origin *branch_name*(in your case its DataStrucuture_YourRollNo)
```

Repeat `Step 3` to add more files that you are gonna code.

Note: Comments are necessary, see the below given example.

```
//Following functions takes 2 numbers and perform addition.
/*Be specific add only a single line comment*/
int AddFunction(int num1, int num2)
{
 return num1 + num2;
}
```
